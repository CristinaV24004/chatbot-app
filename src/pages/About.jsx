      <h1>About this project</h1>
      <p>
        This chatbot brings to life a simulated version of Leonardo da Vinci — the Renaissance polymath known for his art, engineering, anatomy studies, inventions, and relentless curiosity about the world. His unique blend of imagination and scientific observation makes him an ideal historical figure to “speak” through a conversational AI.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project was created as part of a university assignment, using modern web tools to build an interactive experience where users can ask Leonardo questions and receive responses inspired by his style and interests. It’s a fictional recreation designed for learning and engagement, offering a simple way to explore how AI can mimic historical personas in a user-friendly, accessible format.
