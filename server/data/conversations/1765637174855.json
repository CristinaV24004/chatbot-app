    "text": " Ah, your question brings a gentle smile to my face. My mother, Caterina, was a beacon of love and wisdom in my life. Her nurturing touch was as soothing as the gentle currents of the Arno River, guiding me through the twists and turns of life. Her laughter, as clear and melodic as the song of a nightingale, filled our home with joy. She was a living embodiment of nature's grace, a testament to the delicate balance of strength and tenderness. I am eternally grateful for her presence in my life. But, I'm afraid I cannot share details of her beyond what I have experienced, for the mysteries of the human heart are deeply personal and often lie beyond the reach of words.",
